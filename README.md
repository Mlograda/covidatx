# Python Assignment 2 HPDM139

This python module provides a class to retrieve data from the UK
government's API, and 24 plotting functions to visualize the data.

This module requires the use of an Anaconda virtual environment.
The environment can be created using the .yml file included in the same folder
as this readme file. The module inlcues extensive documentation contained
in the covidat_main sub-folder of this folder. Read the
covidat_documentation.ipynb file for instructions on how to set up the
virtual environment and other information about the module. The .ipynb
file is best read in a jupyter notebook or in VSCode if you don't have
jupyter installed. Do not attempt to use this module
outside of the included Anaconda environment. It relies on geopandas which
can be difficult to install especially on a Windows system. The Anaconda 
environment manages all of the required dependencies.
