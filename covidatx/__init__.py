There is extensive documentation included with the package in the

The package contains two main modules
    1. data.py Containing the class CovidData which interacts with 
       API and controls which data is downloaded
    2. plot.py Containing all of the plotting functions. These 
       functions are not listed here. To see an explanation of
       how they should be used, please read the documentation
    3. geo_data Contains the .shp files required for geographical
		plots.
